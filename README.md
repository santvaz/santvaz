# 🍭 Hi there ! 
<img align='right' src="https://cdn128.picsart.com/212176513001202.gif" width='170'/>

My name is **Sandra** and I'm from Spain! 

I've just finished my Master's Degree in **Frontend Web Development**. Currently working on my personal projects to build my portfolio! 😊 

Currently working on UI frameworks like React and trying to dive into my favorite stack: **React**, **NodeJS**, **TypeScript/JavaScript** and **TailwindCSS**.

I'm a big fan of UX/UI and Penetration Testing, hopefully I'll be able to expand my knowledge through these amazing mini worlds.

## 🌸 Technologies
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- React
- TailwindCSS / Bootstrap
- NextJS
- NodeJS

## ✨ About me 
More onto the personal side, I'm looking forward to taking the **C2 Cambridge CEFR Certification** & **eJPT Certification from INE Security**.
