# 🍭 Hi there ! 
<img align='right' src="https://cdn128.picsart.com/212176513001202.gif" width='170'/>

My name is **Sandra** and I'm from Spain! 

I've just finished my Master's Degree in **Frontend Web Development**. Currently working on my personal projects to build my portfolio! 😊 

Also learning front-end tools like **React**, **NextJS** and **TypeScript**. Still looking forward to learning **Angular**. 

I'm a big fan of UX/UI and building usable, equitative, enjoyable and good-looking user interfaces in order to make the user happier with a product.
